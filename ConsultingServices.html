        <h1>Blockchain</h1>
        
           <p style="font-size:160%;">A system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or 
            another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.
            The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner.
            By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied, blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of internet.
            The information in a blockchain is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent 
            and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.</p>

         <h1>Autonomous Things</h1>
         
         <p style="font-size:160%;">
            Autonomous is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, 
            freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects. They are all based on recent breakthroughs in the domains of (deep) machine learning and artificial intelligence.
            They all require extensive and prompt regulatory developments to specify the requirements from them and to license and manage their deployment[16] (see the further reading below). 
            And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., automobile safety) and security,
            to overcome concerns about the potential negative impact of the new technology. 
            An expample of how autonomous things are being used:</p>

                <li> A plan for Dubai to use autonomous police vehicles that can deploy their own drones for surveillance.</li>   
                <li>Cooperative merge scenarios by Honda and other car manufacturers, in which vehicles communicate with one another to optimize traffic flows. </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Immersive Experience</h1>
            <p style="font-size:160%;">
                An Immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you 
                such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it.
                The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality
                There are two types of Immersive experiences, one being when you are actually in a physical environment and the other where you are shown around a real or imagined environment via desktop,
                tablet, mobile or via VR( Virtual Reality) headset.</p>
