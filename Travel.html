            During the summer of 2018 myself and my friends decided to go Inter-railing after completing the Leaving Certificate.
            We started our route in Amsterdam,after a few days there we got the train to Berlin where we only spent the night and soon we were on the way to Prague.
            Prague was a gorgeous city with a great nightlife and exciting atmosphere.
            <br>
                Soon after we made our way to Budapest,one of my favourite cities.
                Budapest was filled with amazing architecture and fascinating monuments. it is a great place for food and culture.Our last stop was Split,Croatia. this was our small sun holiday.
                The weather was lovely everyday the temperatures would reach 30 degrees.Split was another one of my favourite places, we would go to the beach everyday and the nightlife was also 
                exciting with many other people inter-railing around Europe.
                
                <br>
                    Overall,I would highly recommend inter-railing to anyone interested in travelling in the future.
